# Scripts  

_First exercice_ : Memmorypuzzle.py  

**_How to Play Memory Puzzle_**:  

_In the Memory Puzzle game, several icons are covered up by white boxes. There are two of each
icon. The player can click on two boxes to see what icon is behind them. If the icons match, then
those boxes remain uncovered. The player wins when all the boxes on the board are uncovered.
To give the player a hint, the boxes are quickly uncovered once at the beginning of the game._
