# Scripts  

_First exercice_ : Memmorypuzzle.py  

**_How to Play Memory Puzzle_**:  

_In the Memory Puzzle game, several icons are covered up by white boxes. There are two of each
icon. The player can click on two boxes to see what icon is behind them. If the icons match, then
those boxes remain uncovered. The player wins when all the boxes on the board are uncovered.
To give the player a hint, the boxes are quickly uncovered once at the beginning of the game._

**_How to play Simulate game_**:  

Simulate is a clone of the game Simon. There are four colored buttons on the screen. The buttons
light up in a certain random pattern, and then the player must repeat this pattern by pressing the
buttons in the correct order. Each time the player successfully simulates the pattern, the pattern
gets longer. The player tries to match the pattern for as long as possible.

**_How to play Wormy_**  

Wormy is a Nibbles clone. The player starts out controlling a short worm that is constantly moving around the screen. The player cannot stop or slow down the worm, but they can control which direction it turns. A red apple appears randomly on the screen, and the player must move the worm so that it eats the apple. Each time the worm eats an apple, the worm grows longer by one segment and a new apply randomly appears on the screen. The game is over if the worm crashes into itself or the edges of the screen.
